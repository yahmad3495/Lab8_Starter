Q1.) Option 1 is correct as it will ensure that any code that is pushed will have to go through some quality checks so that the code is working
before moving onto the next part of development. Manually running tests would work, but would be inefficient and a perfect task for automation libraries
like Jest to do.

Q2.) No, for a test like that you would want to use a unit test. Unit tests are appropriate for ensuring the individual components or functions are
returning the correct values.
